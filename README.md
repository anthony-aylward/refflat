# refflat
refflat package for R

This package is designed to plot the locations of genes within a small genomic
interval. It is useful, for example, to draw genes below a GWAS signal
for context. See also an [example](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/islet-cytokines-outline/raw/master/nfatc2-ENSG00000101096.pdf) of a plot created using `refflat`.
